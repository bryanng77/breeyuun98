#### I am a first year student pursuing a degree in Data Science and Business Analytics at the University of London (UOL) under Singapore Instituite of Management Global Education (SIMGE). I graduated with a Business Studies diploma from Ngee Ann Polytechnic, and this experience has allowed me to gain insight into real business environments and challenges. 

#### I am adequately proficient in software such as Tableau, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Word and Microsoft PowerPoint. Through online courses and programs, I have self-taught myself Python and MySQL.


#### â€œIf it doesn't challenge you, it won't change you", is quote that I keep In mind each day. I am highly motivated and will constantly push myself to improve. I am highly curious and willing to take up new challenges and skills.
